- 'SOS! THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.'

## Use the Morse Code Dictionary I've сompiled for you
The dictionary is located in this folder, which is with the readme file

## 📋 I recommend to write your code step by step

#### First of all, you should teach to split a string into elements.
- Read the article about string type in the book.
- Read about "split" command for string type
- Write a code that will display all the elements of a string in the list, like this: 'HEY JUDE' --> ['HEY', 'JUDE']

#### Now should teach to work with dictionary.
- Read about dictionary type in the book.
- Read about "for...in..." in the internet
- Take this code --> fruits = {1: 'apple', 2: 'orange', 3: 'banana'} and write a code that will find any fruit and print its numer. Add your code to this template.

In this case you should have "2" as a result, because 'orange' has '2' as a key.

#### 🎯 Combining this skills, I guess, you will can solve this.
