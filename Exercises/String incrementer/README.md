# ✌🏻 What's up, today you have to write a string incrementer
## 🎯 Task
Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.
- If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
- If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

### Example: foo -> foobar23 -> foobar24
